# Battleship
A game of Battleship written in Java

# Important
This application will not be updated anymore. I designed this back when I knew coding but didn't know good coding practices. As a result, this codebase is a mess. I will start working on a new client over at [battleship-client](https://github.com/NoGoat/battleship-client). For funsies, I will document everything wrong with it here.

# Dependencies
JDK 1.8.0_202

# IDE
IntelliJ IDEA

# Remaining work
- [x] An alarm style indicator that lets you know which ship is currently being attacked
- [ ] Adding models for ships
- [x] Modifying so that the computer actually attacks instead of just hitting random spots
- [ ] Minor visual bugfixes
- [x] Sound effects
