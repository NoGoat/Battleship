# Battleship
A game of Battleship written in Java

# Why I made this
When I was in school, our school used to have an annual event every year on November 14. The goal of this event was to give the students an oppurtunity to showcase someting creative. Well, during my last year in that school, I wanted to do something special. So, I started making this game in Python as a console game. And the same year, we got a new Principal, who in his infinite wisdom scheduled an exam for the final year students on that day. As a result, I stopped working on it. After November 14, the dude announced that final year students would get the chance to do the event on another day ... with 3 days notice. 

I was only done with one quarter of the game and I had around 72 hours to work on three quarters of the game (The announcement about the exam came about a couple of months before November 14. So, 2 months of development time was cut down to around 72 hours). So, I ended up rushing the game (BTW that was one of my first experience of an all nighter) and presented a monstrosity on that day. The project that I loved making so much was so horrible that I hated it effectively. So, I tried to forget it.

But, I always had one wish in my mind - The game must be finished.

And so, I finally decided to bite the bullet and make the game again - But this time since I've gotten more programming experience, i decided to either do it in Java or C#. Ultimately I settled on Java.

As for the Python version - I still have the files - I don't think I'll ever release it to the public.

The only remaining remnant of the Python version is the logo of this game - The logo was made as an ASCII art for that game.
